# This file marks the 'data_pipeline' directory as a Python package.
# It can be empty, or it can be used to define package-level imports,
# variables, or initialization code.
# For this project, its primary purpose is to enable module imports
# like 'from src.data_pipeline.retriever import ProductRetriever'.
